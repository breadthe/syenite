At the highest level, Syenite is built on [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/), with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). But there are  more bits and pieces that make it work.

## mdsvex

[mdsvex](https://mdsvex.com/) is what allows Svelte code to exist and be executed from markdown files. This is cool because it allows dynamic components in markdown pages and articles, if you need it.

One example in Syenite is the `src/components/UpdatedAt.svelte` component.

You might wonder why would I need such a component when I can just get the `updated` timestamp from the frontmatter. Well, that's because sometimes I want the updated date to be "evergreen", in other words to always show today's date. Bbbut why?? I have a very specific thing in mind for the future (I said this engine was *opinionated af*, didn't I?).

## Swyxkit

I lifted and adapted many parts from [Swyxkit](https://www.swyx.io/). I like a lot about that engine, but it's a bit too feature-packed for me, plus it lacks a few things I want. Here are some things I poached.

- the dark/light toggle (`src/components/DarkModeToggle.svelte`)
- RSS (`src/routes/rss.xml/+server.js`) and sitemap (`src/routes/sitemap.xml/+server.js`)
- the table of contents (`src/components/TableOfContents.svelte`)
- the `head` metadata stuff - tedious and boring stuff, glad someone else has handled it

## Obsidian integration

In theory, using Obsidian to write articles sounds straightforward. Just point the vault to a folder inside the blog codebase and start writing. Then SvelteKit + mdsvex takes care of the rest, right?

Well, not so fast. There's the not-insignificant matter of internal document references that need to be converted to URLs, with a similar thing for images and other assets.

In other words, we want to convert links:

```
\[\[syenite-blog-engine|Syenite an opinionated blog engine]]

ðŸ‘‡

<a href="http://example.com/2023/09/syenite-blog-engine">
```

and images:

```
!\[\[horse-head.png|Horse head]]

ðŸ‘‡

<img src="/assets/horse-head.png" title="Horse head" alt="Horse head">
```

This is not trivial. So rather than shattering my brain trying to figure it out, I thought "surely someone else must have done it already". Thankfully, a developer named [Frank Noirot](https://franknoirot.co/) did the legwork and wrote an article about it https://github.com/franknoirot/obsidian-sveltekit-blog/.

While he only implemented document links (anchors), as soon as I made the first rough prototype I realized that images work differently. The heavy lifting had already been done so all I had left was to add very similar code to deal with images.

This logic can be found in `src/lib/utils/index.js`. The code may look messy, and some of it is repeating, but it's all good - it works and that's all that matters!

### This doesn't work... yet

One Obsidian feature that is unsupported (it will throw a compile error) is referencing headings in an article.

This

```
\[\[syenite-blog-engine#The Frankenblog]]
```

should resolve to `/2023/09/syenite-blog-engine#the-frankenblog`.

Similarly, a heading containing inline code such as

```
\[\[url-and-folder-structure#Static pages as `.md` files]]
```

should resolve to `/2023/09/url-and-folder-structure#static-pages-as-md-files`.

## Other

Additionally, Syenite uses several [[3rd-party-services|tools and services]] to make life easier.
