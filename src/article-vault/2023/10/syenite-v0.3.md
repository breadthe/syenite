Syenite v0.3 has been released.

## New features

### âœ¨ External link behavior (for articles)

External links in articles now have a ðŸ”— icon attached and open in a new tab. To be considered external, a URL must not be relative, and must be prefixed with `http(s)://`.

In contrast, internal links are relative links pointing to another blog article.

Here's how an external Obsidian link is transformed to HTML:

```html
\[Frank Noirot](https://franknoirot.co/)

<a target="_blank" href="https://franknoirot.co/" rel="nofollow">Frank Noirot ðŸ”—</a>
```

## Improvements

### ðŸ›  Obsidian heading link support

In addition to the Obsidian links supported in v0.1, the following types and patterns have been made possible in v0.3.

**v0.1** Simple link to another Obsidian document with optional link text

```html
\[\[3rd-party-services]]
<a href="/2023/09/3rd-party-services">3rd-party-services</a>

\[\[3rd-party-services|3rd party services]]
<a href="/2023/09/3rd-party-services">3rd party services</a>
```

**v0.3** Link to a heading in another Obsidian document with optional link text

```html
\[\[3rd-party-services#tailgraph.com]]
<a href="/2023/09/3rd-party-services#tailgraph-com">3rd-party-services#tailgraph.com</a>

\[\[url-and-folder-structure#Static pages as `.md` files]]
<a href="/2023/09/url-and-folder-structure#static-pages-as-md-files">url-and-folder-structure#Static pages as <code>.md</code> files</a>

\[\[url-and-folder-structure#Static pages as `.md` files|Static pages as .md files]]
<a href="/2023/09/url-and-folder-structure#static-pages-as-md-files">Static pages as .md files</a>
```

Key highlight here, beside how awesome it is to *link to a specific heading in another article*, is that the hashmark text is sanitized and transformed to snake-case, to match the Table of Contents.

### ðŸ’„ Centered images

Article images are now centered.

### ðŸ’„ Full height layout

The main body of each page now expands to the full height of the window regardless of how little content is on the page.
