# Syenite

A *very* opinionated SvelteKit static markdown blog engine that uses Obsidian as CMS.

[Demo](https://syenite.vercel.app/)

## Credits

Heavily inspired, and based on ideas from:

- [SwyxKit](https://github.com/swyxio/swyxkit)
- [Frank Noirot - Obsidian SvelteKit blog](https://github.com/franknoirot/obsidian-sveltekit-blog)
- [Josh Collinsworth static SvelteKit markdown blog](https://joshcollinsworth.com/blog/build-static-sveltekit-markdown-blog)

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
